:ðŸ“˜ Find the Smallest and Largest Element in an Array
ðŸ§  Short Logic

1.Ask the user how many numbers they want to enter.

2.Store all numbers in an array.

3.Assume the first number is both smallest and largest.

4.Go through the array:

5.If a number is smaller â†’ update smallest.

6.If a number is larger â†’ update largest.

7.Remember their positions.

8.Print the smallest and largest numbers with their positions.

âœ… Example:
Input â†’ 12 45 7 89 3 56
Output â†’ Smallest = 3 (at 4), Largest = 89 (at 3)
